## fizzy-jeli api

That's the backend for my e-shop called "fizzy-jeli". You can find the frontend [here](https://github.com/pagiannis/fizzy-jeli). It's written in node.js/express.js and connected to a mongo database.

Using:

- JWT'S for email verification tokens
- random crypto tokens for password reset
